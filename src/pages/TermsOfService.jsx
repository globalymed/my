Medyatra Terms of Service
Effective Date: July 11, 2025
Last Updated: July 11, 2025
Version: v1

Welcome to Medyatra. These Terms of Service (“Termsˮ) govern your access to and use of Medyatraʼs website, mobile application, and related services (collectively, the “Platformˮ). By accessing or using the Platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, you must not use the Platform. Medyatra is based in India and currently serves users only in jurisdictions where it is authorized to operate.

1. Changes to Our Services and Terms
Service Modifications: We may modify, update, or discontinue any part of the Platform, including AI features, booking processes, or data-sharing partnerships, at our discretion. We will provide reasonable notice (e.g., via email or Platform notifications) at least 30 days before significant changes take effect. For material updates, we may require affirmative user acceptance (e.g., via a prompt). Material updates will require affirmative acceptance via Platform prompt. You must accept to continue using the Platform. Your continued use of the Platform after such notice constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
Minor Updates: Clarifications, bug fixes, or compliance-driven edits may take effect immediately without prior notice. We aim to maintain transparency in all updates.

2. Eligibility and Use by Minors
Age Requirement: You must be at least 18 years old to use the Platform independently. Users under 18 may access the Platform only with verifiable parental or guardian consent and supervision, particularly for the collection of personal or health information.
Verification: We may request proof of age or consent. Failure to provide such proof may result in account suspension or termination.
Restricted Jurisdictions: The Platform is intended for users in jurisdictions where Medyatra is authorized to operate. We do not offer or market services to residents of jurisdictions where we are not licensed, such as the European Union (EU), United Kingdom (UK), or Australia. By using the Platform, you represent and warrant that you are not located in these jurisdictions. We employ IP filtering, geofencing, and other technical measures to restrict access from these regions. If access is restricted in error, contact us at contact@medyatra.space to verify your jurisdiction. If we expand into new jurisdictions, we will update these Terms accordingly.

3. Data Rights, Privacy, and Security
User Data Rights: You may request access, correction, deletion, or export of your personal data in a structured, machine-readable format, subject to applicable laws, such as Indiaʼs Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP Act). We do not offer services in the EU and disclaim obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Data inadvertently collected from restricted jurisdictions will be deleted promptly without further obligation.
Data Deletion and Retention: Upon account deletion, we will delete or anonymize your data unless retention is required for legal compliance or dispute resolution.
Cookies and Tracking: We use cookies and similar technologies for analytics, functionality, and marketing purposes. You may disable cookies through your browser settings, but this may affect Platform functionality. We respect “Do Not Trackˮ signals where applicable.
Cross-Border Data Transfers: By using the Platform, you consent to the transfer of your personal data to countries with differing data protection standards, subject to safeguards like Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for legacy or incidental data from restricted regions.
Security Measures: We implement industry-standard security measures, including encryption and access controls. Notify us immediately of any suspected security breach at contact@medyatra.space.
Business Continuity: We maintain data backup, disaster recovery, and continuity procedures to minimize service interruptions and data loss. However, we do not guarantee full or immediate recovery in all scenarios.
Breach Notification: In the event of a data breach, we will notify the Data Protection Board of India and other Indian regulators as required by law, unless different regional requirements apply.
Sensitive Data Warning: Information submitted, including health-related data, is not reviewed by a licensed healthcare professional unless explicitly stated. Do not use the Platform for time-sensitive, emergency, or life-threatening medical concerns. AI or automated tools may process your input without clinical validation.
Jurisdictional Exclusion: See Section 2 for details on restricted jurisdictions.

4. Automated Decisions and AI Transparency
AI Outputs: AI-driven recommendations are for informational purposes only and may contain errors or biases. We do not guarantee their accuracy or reliability. Recommendation outputs should not be acted upon without professional consultation.
No Medical Advice: AI-generated content is not a substitute for professional medical diagnosis or treatment. Always consult a licensed healthcare provider.
Model Limitations and Bias: AI outputs are based on general datasets and algorithms that may not be tailored to your specific circumstances and may reflect biases or outdated information. We do not audit third-party datasets and disclaim liability for harm resulting from AI outputs.
Human Oversight: We do not rely solely on automated processing for decisions with significant legal or similar effects. Final decisions are your responsibility or that of a qualified professional. Use of the Platform does not establish a doctor-patient relationship. Report suspected AI issues to contact@medyatra.space.

5. Accessibility and Non-Discrimination
We strive to comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA and Indiaʼs Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. For accessibility issues or accommodation requests, contact us at contact@medyatra.space, and we will respond within 5 business days.

6. Third-Party Services and Integrations
Third-Party Services: The Platform integrates with third-party services (e.g., hotels, flights, hospitals). We are not responsible for their content, availability, or performance.
Developer API: Use of our public APIs is subject to separate Developer Terms, including rate limits and anti-abuse measures. You may not use our APIs to build competing services, redistribute data, or create derivative works without written permission. API access may be terminated for misuse or violation of these Terms.

7. Service Levels and Availability
We aim for 24/7 availability but do not guarantee uninterrupted service. Planned maintenance will be announced when feasible. No service credits are currently offered.
Enterprise SLAs: Enterprise partners may enter separate agreements defining specific uptime, response times, and service commitments. Such SLAs will supersede these Terms for their duration and scope.

8. Support and Complaints Process
Customer Support: Contact us at contact@medyatra.space. We will acknowledge inquiries within 3 business days. “Business daysˮ are Monday through Friday, excluding Indian public holidays.
Grievance Handling: Until a permanent Grievance Officer is appointed, direct complaints to contact@medyatra.space. A founding team member in India will respond within 15 days, in accordance with Indiaʼs IT Rules. A permanent Grievance Officer will be appointed promptly.
Escalation: Unresolved complaints may be escalated to the Data Protection Board of India or other applicable regulators in jurisdictions where we operate.

9. Content Moderation and Takedown
User-Generated Content: You are responsible for content you submit. Unlawful or infringing content will be removed under notice-and-takedown procedures, typically within 48 hours of notice, in accordance with Indiaʼs IT Rules.
License Grant: By submitting content, you grant Medyatra a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, store, and display it for Platform operations.

10. Professional Liability and Insurance
Provider Requirements: Healthcare providers on the Platform must hold valid licenses and professional liability insurance as required by local regulations.
Verification Limits: While we may conduct background checks on providers, we do not independently verify all credentials unless stated. You are responsible for verifying provider credentials directly.
Agency Disclaimer: Medyatra does not employ or supervise healthcare providers and does not influence their medical decisions. We act solely as a facilitator. All treatment decisions are between you and the provider.
Provider Conduct: Providers must provide accurate, up-to-date information about their qualifications and services. We may suspend or terminate relationships with providers engaging in false advertising or unethical practices. Report discrepancies to contact@medyatra.space.
Indemnification: You agree to indemnify and hold Medyatra, its affiliates, and personnel harmless from claims, damages, or liabilities arising from third-party services (e.g., hospitals, hotels, travel agents) accessed through the Platform.
Operational Liability Limitation: We are not liable for losses due to technical errors, booking delays, scheduling conflicts, or miscommunications, except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. You must verify all bookings and service details.

11. Force Majeure
Neither party is liable for delays caused by events beyond their reasonable control (e.g., natural disasters, pandemics, government actions, or network outages). The affected party will notify the other promptly.

12. Termination, Suspension, and Survival
By You: You may delete your account at any time via Platform settings or by contacting support.
By Us: We may suspend or terminate your access for violations of these Terms or illegal conduct, with notice unless immediate action is required.
Surviving Provisions: Provisions related to data rights, liability limitations, indemnification, dispute resolution, and governing law survive termination.

13. API Use and Abuse Prevention
Rate Limiting: API usage is subject to published limits. Abuse may result in suspension or legal action.
Prohibited Actions: You may not engage in denial-of-service attacks, vulnerability scanning, or other malicious activities against the Platform.

14. Payments, Refunds, and Chargebacks
Current Status: The Platform is currently free. Terms for paid services will be updated when introduced.
Medical Tourism Refunds: Refunds for third-party services (e.g., hospitals, hotels, travel) are subject to the providersʼ policies. Refunds are not available for completed medical procedures, non-cancellable bookings, visa rejections, or no-shows. Refund requests will be assessed case-by-case.
Unauthorized Access Refunds: Users accessing paid services from restricted jurisdictions are not entitled to refunds. At Medyatraʼs sole discretion, a refund may be issued as a goodwill gesture within 30 days of the transaction. This does not waive any term rights or establish jurisdictional claims.
Chargebacks: Contact us at contact@medyatra.space to resolve disputes before initiating chargebacks. Fraudulent disputes may result in legal or financial liability, including collection of costs.

15. Localization and Language
Controlling Language: The English version of these Terms governs. Translations are provided for convenience only.
Local Consumer Rights: These Terms are subject to consumer protection laws only in jurisdictions where Medyatra operates. See Section 2 for details on restricted jurisdictions.
Data Localization: We comply with applicable data localization laws, such as Indiaʼs DPDP Act, which may impose specific storage obligations.

16. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
Governing Law: These Terms are governed by the laws of India.
Jurisdiction: Disputes shall be resolved exclusively in the courts of New Delhi, India, unless mandatory local law applies.
Informal Resolution: Before pursuing formal legal action, you agree to attempt informal resolution by contacting contact@medyatra.space.
Prohibited Misuse: You may not impersonate Medyatra personnel, misrepresent affiliations, or engage in fraud, harassment, or unlawful solicitation. Such actions may result in immediate suspension and legal action.
Versioning: These Terms are Version 1. Prior versions will be maintained, and a summary of changes is available upon request or on the Platform.

17. Entire Agreement
These Terms, along with our Privacy Policy and any incorporated documents, constitute the entire agreement between you and Medyatra regarding the Platform. If any provision is deemed invalid, the remaining provisions remain in effect.
